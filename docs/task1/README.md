# Description
In this task, we will learn how to deploy this app. It is straight forward, as all docker images can run either in K8S/k3s/Volterra or any other Kubernetes environment.

As a reminder, this is the application workflow.

# Deploy the WORDS microservices
First of all, deploy the 4 WORD microservices
- locations
- animals
- adjectives
- colors

Please clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/fchmainy/nginx-aks-demo.git
```

## Deploy All Microservices in one
We created a YAML deployment with the 4 microservices (pods + services)

Run this command in your Kubernetes environment

```
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/attributes/all_attributes.yaml
```

This command will deploy 4 `PODS` and 4 `SERVICES` in **ClusterIP** mode. All `services` listen on port 80 and all `PODS` on port 8080.

# Deploy the Generator
As a reminder, the generator is a python application calling each microservice to get a WORD (randomly). This generator POD listens on port **8080**, and his service on port **80**.

```
vi k8s/attributes/generator-direct.yaml
```

Modify the YAML deployment with the right `NAMESPACE` value at the end. This value is the NAMESPACE where the 4 microservices run (deployed in the previous step). The `generator` needs this information to reach the service in K8S.

> Example of call done by the `generator` to get the color word: curl http://colors.api/colors

> `Colors` is the service name, `api` is the namespace

Then, run the deployment
```
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/attributes/generator-direct.yaml
```

> You can notice 2 kind of `generator`deployment. The other YAML deployment file can be use in the task when an API Gateway is used between the `generator` and the `words` services.

# Deploy the Frontend application (webapp)
In order to display the final sentence, we can run a `web application` that will call the `generator`.
This web application is not mandatory in case you just want to use this lab for an API demo/use case.

Edit the YAML deployment file in order to specify the `NAMESPACE` of the `generator`. This web application can be deployed in another namespace for instance. But this web application needs to know where is the generator service.

```
vi .k8s/attributes/frontend-namespace-generator.yaml
```

```
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/attributes/frontend-namespace-generator.yaml
```

## Publish the services
You can publish `frontend` or `generator` services outside your K8S. To do so, change the YAML Service blob from `ClusterIP` to `NodePort`.

One example below to publish the `Frontend` externaly.

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: frontend
```

Find the port used by the `NodePort`
```
kubectl get services
```

> And connect to your node with this port **http://node_IP:NodePort**
